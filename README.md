# IntroJSX
An extended version of the known Intro.js<br />
<br />
 2015 Dimitris Misdanitis<br />
<br />
 Inspired and extended Afshin Mehrabani's (@afshinmeh) Intro.js<br />
<br />

 Why to use IntoJSX /what differs from Intro.js:<br />
 *0)* The "core" functions re-designed <br />
 *1)* showHint (badge) functionality. When you just want to make the user notice something. No need to start an introduction!<br />
 *2)* You can combine html and DOM introduction elements.<br />
 *3)* Every introduction element has a property "duration" (in seconds). So the element will disappear after that time or it will go to the next step.<br />
 *4)* autoPlay functionality. No need to click/press keys to go to the next step.<br />
 *5)* You can dynamically append or replace a introduction element using JS.<br />
 *6)* the _showElement function was messy, so re-written.<br />
 *7)* Introduction element types: "tooltip", "badge" , "floating"<br />
 *8)* Some ui improvements<br />
<br />
 Downsides: No callbacks. Actually i don't need them now, maybe later.<br />
